Title: &quot;Deploy and Scale Microservices on Kubernetes with Apache Reverse Proxy and
CI/CD&quot;

Objective:
Create a multi-service app deployed on Kubernetes with Apache acting as a reverse
proxy and integrate CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

Task Breakdown:

1. Create 2â€“3 microservices using Node.js (e.g., blog API, auth, and analytics).

2. Containerize the services and create:

Kubernetes Deployments (with autoscaling)

Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP or LoadBalancer)

ConfigMaps or Secrets

3. Install and configure Apache as a reverse proxy (inside a container or on host) to
forward traffic to services.

4. Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to:

Build images

Push to Docker Hub

Submission Requirements:

GitHub repo and Docker Hub image links

YAML files and Apache config

Screenshot of services scaling up

Proof of deployment and proxy working (e.g., curl, browser)
